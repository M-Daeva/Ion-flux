      Welcome to Ion Flux dApp, the single sided liquidity model DEX that allows
      you to exchange tokens without any price impact and provide liquidity
      without the risk of impermanent loss. Here's a step-by-step guide on how
      to use it.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      First, connect your wallet and get test tokens using the faucet integrated
      into the app. You can view your balances on the dashboard.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Once you have test tokens, you can start swapping them. The amount you
      swap does not affect the exchange rate. A portion of the incoming token
      will be distributed between liquidity providers based on demand and asset
      allocation.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Exploring liquidity page, you can find info about the rewards for
      liquidity providers in different tokens and the overall cost. You can
      claim rewards or swap them for a specified token and then claim them. The
      last option is zero-fee operation.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      On the liquidity page, you can see all existing pools and some useful
      statistics. For example, the higher the token weight, the greater the
      rewards for providing liquidity. As always, low liquidity pools are more
      profitable.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      To provide liquidity, click on the Apply button, select the Deposit
      option, specify the amount, and click on the Execute button. If you want
      to get back your tokens, you need to Unbond and wait for a certain time
      period to be able to withdraw them. Both Deposit and Unbonding affect
      token weight.
    </p>

      We hope you find this guide helpful and enjoy using the app!
